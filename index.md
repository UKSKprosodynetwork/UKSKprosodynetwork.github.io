# UK-South Korea Prosody Research Network

This project establishes an international network of psychologists, linguists, and phoneticians with the common goal of extending our understanding of the human faculty for the production, perception and cognitive processing of speech prosody. This academic network, with core members in the UK and South Korea, will promote and facilitate further cross-linguistic and interdisciplinary research. 

The objectives of the project are to:
- support long-term collaboration and exchange between researchers in the UK and South Korea;
- establish and maintain an interdisciplinary network of researchers to share skills and knowledge in collaborating in speech prosody research;
- provide training and mentoring opportunities for early career researchers;
- diversify target languages and populations in prosody research;
- improve analytical tools and research methods for prosody studies;
- promote and share good practice in open science;
- increase the impact of prosody research in pedagogy and other applied areas; and
- establish a basis for future world-leading research collaborations.

### Call for Papers

Submit your abstract [here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spab2023).

We invite submissions on any aspects of speech prosody. We particularly encourage submissions on interdisciplinary studies, studies using new or unconventional methodology, research with real-world impacts, spontaneous speech, under-researched languages, and the interface between prosody and other aspects of communication, language or cognition.  

All presentations will be face-to-face oral presentations for 20 minutes. We expect approximately 20 presentations. The workshop language is English.

All authors will be invited to express their interest in submitting a full-length paper (8000–14000 words) for a special issue for [Language and Speech](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/las) (eds. Hae-Sung Jeon, Laurence White, Jane Setter and Jiyoun Choi) when submitting an abstract on EasyChair (submission open on 9 January 2023). Following a review process, selected authors will be invited to submit a full paper. The submission date for the full-length paper will be in January 2024. The papers will be subject to the normal peer-review process. Please note that the acceptance of abstracts to the workshop does not guarantee a publication. 


### Abstracts

Presentations will be 20 minutes followed by 10 minutes of discussion. 

The text of the abstract should be anonymous, with a minimum of 11 pt font and no more than two A4 pages in length including references, figures, and tables. They should be in .pdf format. Abstracts should be submitted using the [Easychair site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spab2023).  

### Important dates
- 9 January 2023 — Abstract submission open

### Travel Grants for Students or Early Career Researchers

In order to be eligible for a grant, you will need to be the first author of an accepted paper at the workshop. Currently two travel grants (£1500 each) for students or early career researchers (PhD awarded in/after 2019) affiliated with a UK institution are available. The organisers hope to offer more travel grants for students/ECRs outside the UK -- more information will be available in March 2023. 

When you submit an abstract, you will be able to specify whether you are eligible and would like to be considered for a travel grant. In the selection process, abstracts will be assessed for their relevance to the workshop, originality, significance, accuracy in analysis and clarity in presentation by at least three expert reviewers.
